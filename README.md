_my log has a message for you..._

Log Lady is a log viewer intended for use with structured JSON logs. It will 
output nicely-formatted log lines according to a user-customized format. Logs
which are not readable as JSON will be output verbatim.

_one day my log will have something to say about this..._

Log Lady is still in pre-alpha. Features I hope to implement:
* Fully-customizable formatting
* Colored output
* Filtering
* Searching
* More Twin Peaks quotes
